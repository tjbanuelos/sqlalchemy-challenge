# Find the most recent date in the data set.



# Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plot the results.
# Starting from the most recent data point in the database.

# Calculate the date one year from the last date in data set.


# Perform a query to retrieve the data and precipitation scores


# Save the query results as a Pandas DataFrame. Explicitly set the column names


# Sort the dataframe by date


# Use Pandas Plotting with Matplotlib to plot the data



# Use Pandas to calculate the summary statistics for the precipitation data






# Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset



# Design a query to find the most active stations (i.e. which stations have the most rows?)
# List the stations and their counts in descending order.



# Using the most active station id from the previous query, calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperature.



# Using the most active station id
# Query the last 12 months of temperature observation data for this station and plot the results as a histogram
